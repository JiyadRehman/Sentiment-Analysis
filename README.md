# Sentiment-Analysis
Developed a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. The model was able to differentiate between positive and negative tweets.

Trained a machine learning model on R that was able to identify positive and negative tweets.

To train a model the data was extracted from GitHub and the link for it is shared in the Project Report references.

Finally, after developing a model a separate set of tweets were downloaded that were not part of the train or test set and then prediction was done on that data set.

R code and Project Report are in the repository.
